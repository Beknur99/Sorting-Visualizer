# Sorting-Visualizer
An educational Python program that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work in real time. The application uses matplotlib to visualize arrays as vertical bars that move as the algorithm progresses.

# Features:

Implements Bubble Sort sorting algorithm.

Visualizes each step of the sorting process.

Educational tool for understanding algorithm behavior.

# Technologies:

Python

matplotlib (for visualization)

# Purpose:

Shows familiarity with data structures and algorithms, as well as practical usage of Python visualization libraries.
